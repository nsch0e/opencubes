/**
 * CubeSwapSet: Implement std::unordered_set<> that offloads XYZ data into a file:
 *
 * Cubes stored in the set have reduced cost of memory:
 * Only the std::unordered_set<> itself and the internal nodes are stored in RAM.
 * The element *data* (i.e. XYZ data) is stored in the file.
 * The performance cost is that each time the set element is accessed
 * the data is read back from the file.
 * (Iterating the entire CubeSwapSet involves reading the entire file)
 *
 * Features:
 * - XYZ data is recorded sequentially into the file and
 *   the Cube size is not saved in the storage file.
 * - Cube XYZ data length is constant in CubeStorage instance.
 * - Clearing the CubeSwapSet does not release the file managed by CubeStorage.
 *   (CubePtr(s) cannot be erased from CubeStorage)
 * - CubeStorage::read(const CubePtr&) caches up to 1024 Cubes for each thread.
 *   This read-cache is maintained by any thread that calls CubePtr::get().
 *   CubeStorage::discard() is used to begin writing the XYZ data at new file instance.
 * - CacheWriter utilizes the file instance from CubeStorage:
 *   the CubeSwapSet is not iterated through at all by CacheWriter
 *   and instead CubeStorage::getFile() is assigned into a copy job and then
 *   copied into the cache-file with mapped::file::copyAt().
 *   The source storage file is deleted once the copy is completed.
 *   This provides wait-free saving of the cache-file and uses
 *   minimal amount of system memory.
